# Episode 9: Bus transactions, ROM, code execution

This episode finally has a working version of the 6809 microcomputer circuit!

Schematics (KiCad and PDF) are in the [CircuitWithROM](CircuitWithROM) directory.

Code for the demo program is in the [Code](Code) directory.

I learned 6809 assembly language from a book called [6809 Assembly Language Programming](https://www.amazon.com/assembly-language-programming-Lance-Leventhal/dp/0931988357).  I also found [a webpage with the 6809 instruction set](http://atjs.mbnet.fi/mc6809/Information/6809.htm) to be a useful reference, not only for the instruction set, but also for the binary representation for the instructions, which is useful for checking to see whether or not your program image is correct.
