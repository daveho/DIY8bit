# Episode 8: Address decoding

This episode covers address decoding.  The [GlueLogic](GlueLogic) directory has the schematic showing the full glue logic (bus signals and address decoding), along with the CPU and reset circuit.  This design forms the core of the system.

## Resources

Jan Axelson's excellent [The Microcontroller Idea Book](http://janaxelson.com/microcib.htm) (free PDF download) is a fantastic resource for understanding the essentials of designing 8 bit microcomputer systems, including address decoding.  Although the book covers the Intel 8052, the techniques it covers are useful for pretty much any 8 bit system.

The design and firmware for the 7 segment hexadecimal display shown in the test circuit is here: <https://github.com/daveho/busmon3>.
