# DIY 8-bit computer, Epsiode 5

The SRLatch, DTypeLatch, and [DTypeEdgeTriggered](DTypeEdgeTriggered) directories have the schematics (KiCAD and PDF) for each of the demo circuits.

I haven't included resistor values for the LEDs: I used 806 Ohm resistors with some fairly standard blue LEDs.  Your mileage may vary.
