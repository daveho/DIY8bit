# DIY 8-bit computer, Epsiode 5

The [SRLatch](SRLatch), [DTypeLatch](DTypeLatch), and [DTypeEdgeTriggered](DTypeEdgeTriggered) directories have the schematics (KiCad and PDF) for each of the demo circuits.

I haven't included resistor values for the LEDs: I used 806 Ohm resistors with some fairly standard blue LEDs.  Your mileage may vary.  74HC outputs can typically source about 5 mA, so choose your LEDs and resistors accordingly.  High efficiency LEDs will work better because they require less current.
