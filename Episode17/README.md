# DIY 8-bit computer, Episode 17

Link to video: coming soon

This is a quick video in which I test a revised version of the
CPU and glue logic module PCB for the F68 6809-based microcomputer system.
The revision fixes several problems I found with the original board
revision in the [previous episode](../Episode16).

The [HardwareDesign](HardwareDesign) directory has complete schematics and
PCB designs.

Note that the [Mechanical](../Episode16/Mechanical) directory from
the previous episode has the 3D designs for the mounting clips that secure the
backplane connector to the PCB.
