# DIY 8-bit computer, Episode 13

Link to video: coming soon

In this video, we tie up a few loose ends related to the keyboard, specifically

* constructing a permanent hardware module for the keyboard controller
* better support for keyboard input in the ROM monitor
* 3D printing "legs" for the keyboard so it will sit better on a flat surface

The [Code](Code) directory has the updated monitor firmware. The circuit is the same
as the one in [Episode 12](../Episode12).

The file [backplane.txt](backplane.txt) shows the signals on the backplane connectors
(which have not changed since the previous episode.)
