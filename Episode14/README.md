# DIY 8-bit computer, Episode 14

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/gVFuNtl8WqU>

In this video, I present plans for an enclosure for the 8 bit computer system,
and build a frame for the enclosure which includes a card cage to stabilze
the backplane cards.

The frame for the enclosure is built using 15x15mm aluminum extrusions, specifically
[MakerBeam XL](https://www.makerbeam.com/makerbeamxl/).  [OpenBeam](https://www.makerbeam.com/openbeam/)
is the same profile, but does not have threaded holes at the ends of the beam (which are needed
to use the corner connectors.)

Pictures of the frame:

Two 3D printed parts are used.

Note that you can use the [MakerBeam XL T-Slot nuts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XHQHD4H)
rather than the square M3 nuts, but they are very expensive.

Here is a 3D-printable corner cube, which might be worth considering because the
MakerBeam XL metal ones are expensive: <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3189420>
