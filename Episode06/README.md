# DIY 8-bit computer, Epsiode 6

## Schematics

The [RC\_POR](RC_POR), [Manual\_POR](Manual_POR), [MAX708\_POR](MAX708_POR), and [TL7705A\_POR](TL7705A_POR) directories have schematics (KiCad and PDF) for the power-on reset circuits presented in this episode.

## Finding the chips

You can get both the MAX708 and TL7705A at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com).  The MAX708 is fairly expensive (around &#36;4.25 US), but the TL7705A is fairly cheap (around &#36;0.75 US).  This is probably your best bet if you want to get genuine parts.

[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com) is also a possibility, but some of the listings will be for parts of dubious authenticity.  I actually did order a bunch of MAX708 chips from a Chinese seller, and I'm pretty sure they are refurbished (because they don't look like the genuine ones I have), but they do seem to work.  Certain eBay sellers are reputable, and you can get some reasonably good deals if you're careful.

Make sure you get the DIP (e.g. PDIP) packaging!  For example, the MAX708CPA is a MAX708 variant with DIP packaging. TL7705AIP is a TL7705A variant with DIP packaging.
