This directory contains information about the enclosure for the 8-bit computer
system.

## Frame

The frame for the enclosure is built using 15x15mm aluminum extrusions, specifically
[MakerBeam XL](https://www.makerbeam.com/makerbeamxl/).  [OpenBeam](https://www.makerbeam.com/openbeam/)
is the same profile, but does not have threaded holes at the ends of the beam (which is needed
to use the corner connectors.)
